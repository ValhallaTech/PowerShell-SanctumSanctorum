# PowerShell-Scripts
Collection of useful PowerShell scripts

Whenever a script(s) get updated, we'll increase the minor release version by 1. Hopefully, this will help to archive working scripts, if the updated script isn't tested and doesn't work for some reason. This also marks the beginning of using development branches for updating scripts. That way we can update and test a script before the changes are merged to the main branch. Structural changes to the repository will increase the major release version by 1.

tl;dr
There shouldn't be any broken scripts in the main branch and if there is, check a known good release version. Also, regardless of the release version, scripts in the Scripts-Dev directory aren't guaranteed to work.
