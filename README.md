# PowerShell-Scripts
Collection of useful PowerShell scripts

## Purpose
Hopefully, this will help to archive working scripts, if the updated script isn't tested and doesn't work for some reason. We'll be using development branches for updating scripts, mostly. That way we can update and test a script before the changes are merged to the main branch. This is also a learning ground for PowerShell. As more advanced techniques and best practices are learned, the scripts will evolve. Also, note that some of the scripts are bare bones, with no comments, error handling, logging, or advanced methods. These scripts were usually created because of an urgent need and there wasn't any bandwidth to flesh them out. Over time, I will glance over these scripts and make them more robust, if necessary.

## Versioning
Whenever a script(s) get updated, we'll increase the minor release version by 1. Structural changes to the repository will increase the major release version by 1.

#### tl;dr
There shouldn't be any broken scripts in the main branch and if there is, check a known good release version. Also, regardless of the release version, scripts in the Scripts-Dev directory or with test in the filename, aren't guaranteed to work.
